# Data Sources

This project performs a crop-yield prediction across Europe countries from 2000 to 2021. The dataset is collected from the following sources:

- Annual Yield (yield.csv) and Pesticides (pesticides.csv) are collected from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data

- Annual Rainfall (rainfall.csv) and Avg. Temperature (avg_temp_1950-2014.csv and avg_temp_2015-2100.csv) are collected from the World Data Bank: https://data.worldbank.org/

- The data is preprocessed and merged to achieve the final_data.csv file.
